# flashcard-app-capstone

This repository contains the files for a Flashcard React app that is a capstone project for Jenni Grubbs, a student in the Thinkful flex software engineering program.

It is from a cloned starter repository that initially used create React app and had other files added on top of that, with places for the the student to add component files and fill out areas in some existing files. In this case, the student added component files in the src>Layout folder to get things working and meet the requirements of the assignment.

It uses React, JSX, JavaScript, HTML and inline CSS with Bootstrap.

To use this React app, fork and clone the repository, and then run npm init and npm start in the command line.

Among those who contributed to Jenni Grubbs' completion of this project were Jeremy Walker and Jeff Baumgardt, both mentors in the Thinkful program.
